## Description

##### _Created a website that keep track of all the places I have been. Each destination is an object with
multiple properties, such as: location, landmarks, time visited, list of favorite things, and notes. When a user clicks on a place's name, the properties will be displayed. This is a project to practice Object-oriented in JAVASCRIPT and user and business logic interfaces._
